# Coding Guidelines

# General

- Any common functionality should be factored out into a separate file that can be imported into other files needing that functionality.
- All functions, properties, and local variables should have descriptive names (camel case, ex. findAllNearbyContractors).
- All constant variables should be uppercase with words separated by _(ex. String API_KEY)
- All functions, except ones that generate front end elements (ex. widgets), should have a comment block above them that describe what that function does.
- There should be enough and consistent spacing between functions in a file for code readability.
